# Comparison Criteria for ELK Stack Evaluation

## Purpose

This document defines the criteria for comparing OpenTelemetry with ELK Stack to make an informed decision for the observability solution.

## Evaluation Categories

### 1. Implementation Complexity

**OpenTelemetry Baseline:**
- Setup time: ~30 minutes
- Instrumentation time: ~60 minutes
- Learning curve: Medium
- Code changes required: Moderate (SDK integration)
- Configuration files: 3 (docker-compose, collector config, prometheus config)

**ELK Comparison Points:**
- Setup time for Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana
- Log shipping configuration complexity
- APM agent installation and configuration
- Number of configuration files needed
- Code changes required for instrumentation

---

### 2. Resource Consumption

**OpenTelemetry Baseline:**
- Total memory: 164 MiB
- Total CPU (idle): 0.27%
- Disk usage: Minimal (in-memory storage)
- Network overhead: OTLP protocol (efficient binary)

**ELK Comparison Points:**
- Elasticsearch memory requirements
- Logstash processing overhead
- Kibana resource usage
- Total memory footprint
- Disk I/O for log indexing
- Network overhead for log shipping

### 3. Observability Capabilities

**OpenTelemetry Baseline:**

| Capability | Support | Quality | Notes |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|
| Distributed Tracing | ✅ Native | Excellent | Full trace propagation |
| Metrics | ✅ Native | Excellent | Prometheus-compatible |
| Logs | ⚠️ Manual | Good | Structured logging with trace context |
| Log-Trace Correlation | ✅ Yes | Excellent | TraceID in logs |
| Real-time Monitoring | ✅ Yes | Good | ~10-25s delay |
| Historical Analysis | ✅ Yes | Good | Depends on retention |
| Alerting | ⚠️ Via Prometheus | Good | Requires AlertManager |
| Dashboards | ⚠️ Via Grafana | Good | Requires separate tool |

**ELK Comparison Points:**
- Native log aggregation and search
- APM capabilities for tracing
- Metric collection (via Metricbeat)
- Unified UI in Kibana
- Built-in alerting capabilities
- Dashboard creation ease
- Query language power (KQL vs PromQL)

---

### 4. Data Retention & Storage

**OpenTelemetry Baseline:**
- Traces: In-memory (Jaeger all-in-one)
- Metrics: 15 days (Prometheus default)
- Logs: Application logs only
- Storage backend: Pluggable (can use Elasticsearch)

**ELK Comparison Points:**
- Elasticsearch index management
- Data retention policies
- Storage costs
- Compression efficiency
- Query performance on large datasets

---

### 5. Vendor Lock-in & Portability

**OpenTelemetry Baseline:**
- Standard: CNCF open standard
- Vendor neutral: Yes
- Backend flexibility: High (can export to multiple backends)
- Migration ease: Easy (standard protocol)

**ELK Comparison Points:**
- Proprietary vs open source
- Elastic Cloud vs self-hosted
- Migration complexity
- Alternative backend options

---

### 6. Ecosystem & Integration

**OpenTelemetry Baseline:**
- Auto-instrumentation: Available for many frameworks
- Language support: Excellent (Go, Java, Python, .NET, etc.)
- Third-party integrations: Growing
- Community: Large and active (CNCF)
- Documentation: Good but evolving

**ELK Comparison Points:**
- Beats ecosystem (Filebeat, Metricbeat, etc.)
- APM agent availability
- Integration with existing tools
- Community size and maturity
- Documentation quality

---

### 7. Operational Complexity

**OpenTelemetry Baseline:**
- Components to manage: 5 (API, MongoDB, Collector, Jaeger, Prometheus)
- High availability: Requires planning
- Backup/restore: Depends on backend
- Upgrades: Component-by-component
- Troubleshooting: Multiple tools

**ELK Comparison Points:**
- Number of components
- Cluster management complexity
- Backup and restore procedures
- Rolling upgrade support
- Unified troubleshooting

---

### 8. Query & Analysis Capabilities

**OpenTelemetry Baseline:**
- Trace search: Jaeger UI (basic filtering)
- Metric queries: PromQL (powerful but learning curve)
- Log search: Not native (requires separate tool)
- Visualization: Requires Grafana
- Correlation: Manual (via TraceID)

**ELK Comparison Points:**
- Kibana query language (KQL)
- Unified search across logs, metrics, traces
- Visualization capabilities
- Built-in correlation features
- Ad-hoc analysis ease

---

### 9. Cost Considerations

**OpenTelemetry Baseline:**
- Software: Free (open source)
- Infrastructure: ~$10-15/month (AWS t3.small)
- Scaling costs: Linear with data volume
- Support: Community or paid (vendors)

**ELK Comparison Points:**
- Elastic Cloud pricing
- Self-hosted infrastructure costs
- Licensing (Basic vs Platinum)
- Support options and costs
- Total cost of ownership

---

### 10. Security & Compliance

**OpenTelemetry Baseline:**
- TLS support: Yes (not enabled in PoC)
- Authentication: Via backend (Jaeger, Prometheus)
- Authorization: Via backend
- Audit logging: Limited
- Compliance: Depends on backend

**ELK Comparison Points:**
- Built-in security features
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging capabilities
- Compliance certifications
- Data encryption (at rest and in transit)

---

## Scoring Framework

Each criterion will be scored on a scale of 1-5:

- **5:** Excellent - Exceeds requirements
- **4:** Good - Meets requirements well
- **3:** Adequate - Meets basic requirements
- **2:** Poor - Partially meets requirements
- **1:** Inadequate - Does not meet requirements

**Weighting:**
- Critical criteria (1-3, 8): 2x weight
- Important criteria (4-7, 9): 1.5x weight
- Nice-to-have criteria (10): 1x weight
